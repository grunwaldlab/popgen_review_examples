This project was prepared using Rmarkdown.
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a language that creates simple html files.
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is an extension to Markdown that allows us to include R code the resulting html file.
The R code can be displayed in the html file and it can also be executed at the time the html file is created.
This allows us to provide examples of R code, its exeution and results all in one html file.


The files in this repository can be used in several ways.
Files with the html extension can be downloaded to your local computer and opened with a web browser.
Sections containing R code can be copied and pasted from the html into an R console and reproduced.
Users that are familiar with Rmarkdown may want to download the Rmd files and compile the html themselves.
Users familiar with GitHub may want to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.
The goal of Rmarkdown is to provide an easy manner in which to share examples.
