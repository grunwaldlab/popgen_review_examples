The files in this repository can be used in several ways:
- Files with the html extension can be downloaded to your local computer and opened with a web browser.
Make sure the file is saved to your lcoal harddrive before opening it in a browser.
- Sections containing R code can be copied and pasted from the html document into an R console so the example can be reproduced.
- Users that are familiar with Rmarkdown may want to download the Rmd file and compile the html code themselves.
- Users familiar with GitHub may want to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.
- USers can also open the Rproj file in [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

The goal of Rmarkdown is to provide an easy manner in which to share examples.
This project was prepared using Rmarkdown.
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a language that creates simple html files.
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is an extension to Markdown that allows us to include R code in the resulting html file.
The R code can be displayed in the html file and it can also be executed at the time the html file is created.
This allows us to provide examples of R code, its execution and results all in one html file.
